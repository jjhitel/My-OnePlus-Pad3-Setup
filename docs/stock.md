# OxygenOS Tips

## **Where is the Game Assistant?**

Game Assistant app is not pre-installed on OnePlus Pad 3.

1.  Install [Games by HeyTap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplus.games) from Google Play Store.

> **Note:** The global variant of Games app is missing "Championship Mode," which includes Touch Boost. If you need this, install the [ColorOS variant](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/heytap/oneplus-games-3) (with the green icon) instead.

## **Disable Ram expansion**
If you are using the 16GB RAM model (and also for the 12GB model, depending on your usage pattern), it is recommended to turn off Ram expansion for better performance.

To turn it off, go to `About device > RAM > RAM expansion`
