# ColorOS/OxygenOS Tips

## **Where is the Game Assistant?**

Game Assistant app is not pre-installed on OnePlus Pad 3.

On OnePlus Pad 2 Pro, it is pre-installed, but it includes excessive Chinese content. Updating it from Google Play Store is much better while retaining core functionalities.

1. Install/Update [Games by HeyTap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplus.games) from Google Play Store.

> **Note:** The global variant of Games app is missing "Championship Mode," which includes Touch Boost. If you need this, install the [ColorOS variant](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/heytap/oneplus-games-3) (with the green icon) instead.

## **Disable Ram expansion**
If you are using the 16GB RAM model (and also for the 12GB model, depending on your usage pattern), it is recommended to turn off Ram expansion for better performance.

To turn it off, go to `About device > RAM > RAM expansion`

## **Disable permission monitoring**
COS/OOS includes its own aggressive permission monitoring system that is far more restrictive than stock Android.

While intended for security, this feature often acts as an excessive limitation, interfering with legitimate power-user functions like advanced tools (e.g., Shizuku) or specific ADB commands.

Enabling 'Disable permission monitoring' in Developer Options allows you to bypass these overly restrictive controls. This removes inconveniences and grants greater freedom for system customization and the use of advanced applications.
