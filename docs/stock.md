## **Where is the Game Assistant?**

Game Assistant app is not pre-installed on OnePlus Pad 3.

1.  Install [Games by HeyTap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplus.games) from Google Play Store.

> **Note:** The global variant of Games app is missing "Championship Mode," which includes Touch Boost. If you need this, install the [ColorOS variant](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/heytap/oneplus-games-3) (with the green icon) instead.
