# My device is bricked!

## Unlocked Bootloader
If you still have access to Fastboot, you can fix it by following the instructions in [flash-oos](docs/flash-oos.md).

If the partition table is corrupted, obtain and flash `super.img`. It may not completely solve the problem, but it will still allow you to use the device.

## Locked Bootloader
If your device is bricked with a locked bootloader, you will need to flash firmware in EDL (Emergency Download) mode.

OnePlus does not make the tool available to the general public, so you will have to contact a third-party repair service and pay a expensive fee. 

If you can send your device to OnePlus service center, do so.
