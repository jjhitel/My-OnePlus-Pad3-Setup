    ```
    otaripper ota.zip --partitions init_boot
    ```

3.  Copy the extracted `init_boot.img` to your device's internal storage.

6.  A patched file named `kernelsu_next_patched_{date}_{time}.img` will be created in your device's `Downloads` folder. Copy this file back to your PC.

7.  Boot your device into Fastboot mode and connect it to your PC.

8.  In your terminal, run the following commands to flash the patched image:

    ```
    fastboot flash init_boot kernelsu_next_patched_{date}_{time}.img

### **How to Install OTA while Maintaining Root**

After an OTA or local update is installed, **do not reboot**.

#### **For LKM Mode**
Open the KernelSU Next app. Tap the **Install** button in the top right, then go to **Install** -> **Install to Inactive Slot**. After it finishes, reboot the device.

#### **For GKI Mode**
Use [Kernel Flasher](https://github.com/fatalcoder524/KernelFlasher) to install the AK3 zip file to the **Inactive Slot**.

The update will be applied, and root access will be maintained.
